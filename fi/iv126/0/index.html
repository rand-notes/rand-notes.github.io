<h1 id=environments>Environments</h1>
<h2 id=fully-observable-vs-partially-observable>Fully Observable vs Partially Observable</h2>
<p>If an agent&rsquo;s sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time, then we say that he task environment is fully observable. If the agents has no sensors at all then the
environment is <strong>unobservable</strong></p>
<h2 id=single-agent-vs-multi-agent-environments>Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent Environments</h2>
<p>For example, an agent solving a crossword puzzle by itself is clearly in a single-agent enviroment, whereas an agent playing chess is in a two-agent enviroment. Sometimes the border is blurred. The key
is performance measure whose value depends on agent A behavior. For example in chess, the opponent V is trying to maximize its performance measure, which, by the rules of chess, minimizes agent A&rsquo;s
performance measure. This, chess is a <strong>competitive</strong> multiagent environment. On the other hand, in the taxi-driving environment, avoiding collisions maximizes the performance measure of all agents, so its
is a partially <strong>cooperative</strong> multiagent environment.</p>
<h2 id=deterministic-vs-nondeterministic>Deterministic vs Nondeterministic</h2>
<p>If the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent(s), then we say the environment is deterministic; otherwise, it is
nondeterministic.</p>
<p>If the environment is parially observable, however, then it could appear to be nondeterministic. Most real situations are so complex that it is impossible to keep track of all the unobserved aspects; for
practical purposes, they msut be treated as nondeterministic.</p>
<p><strong>We say that a model of the environment is stochastic if it explicitly deals with probabilities.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stochastic != Nondeterministic</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=episodic-cs-sequential>Episodic cs Sequential</h2>
<p>In an episodic task environment, the agent&rsquo;s experience is divided into atomic eppisodes. In each episode the agent receives a percept and then performs a single action. Crucially, the next episode does not depend on the actions taken in previous episodes. In sequential environments, on the other hand, the current decision could affect all future decisions.</p>
<p>Chess and taxi driving are sequential: in both cases, short-term actions can have long-term consequences. On the other hand, detecting defected item on assembly line doesn&rsquo;t affect whether the next part
is defective so it&rsquo;s episodic.</p>
<p>Episodic environments are much simpler than sequential environments because the agent does not need to think ahead.</p>
<h2 id=static-vs-dynamic>Static vs Dynamic</h2>
<p>If the environment can change while an agent is deliberating, then we say the environment is dynamic for that agent; otherwise, it is static. Static environments are easier to deal with because the agent
need not keep looking at the world while it is deciding on an action. Dynamic environments, on the other hand, are continuously asking the agent what it wants to do; if it hasn’t decided yet, that counts
as deciding to do nothing. If the environment itself does not change with the passage of time but the agent’s performance score does, then we say the environment is <strong>semidynamic</strong>.</p>
<p>Taxi driving is clearly dynamic: the other cars and the taxi itself keep movingwhile the driving algorithm dithers about what to do next. Chess, when played with a clock,is semidynamic. Crossword puzzles are static.</p>
<h2 id=discrete-vs-continuous>Discrete vs Continuous</h2>
<p>The discrete/continuous distinction applies to the state of the environment, to the way time is handled, and to the percepts and actions of the agent.</p>
<h2 id=known-vs-unknown>Known vs Unknown</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, this distinction refers not to the environment itself but to the agent&rsquo;s (or designer&rsquo;s) state of knowledge about the &ldquo;laws of physics&rdquo; of the environment. In a known environment, the
outcomes (or outcome probabilities if the environment is nondeterministic) for all actions are given. Obviously, if the environment is unknown, the agent will have to learn how it works in order to make
good decisions.</p>
<p>The distinction between known and unknown environments is not the same as the one between fully and partially observable environments. It is quite possible for a known
environment to be partially observable—for example, in solitaire card games, I know the rules but am still unable to see the cards that have not yet been turned over.</p>
<p>Conversely, an unknown environment can be fully observable—in a new video game, the screen may show the entire game state but I still don’t know what the buttons do until I try them.</p>
<h1 id=the-structure-of-agents>The Structure of Agents</h1>
<p>The job of AI is to design an agent program that implements the agent function—the mapping from percepts to actions. We assume this program will run on some sort of computing device with physical sensors and actuators—we call this the agent architecture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>agent = architecture + program</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=simple-reflex-agents>Simple Reflex Agents</h2>
<p>The simplest kind of agent that select actions on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history.</p>
<p>Use <strong>condition-action rule</strong> &ndash; <code>**if** car-in-front-is-braking **then** initiate-braking</code></p>
<p>Sometimes we can create rules that will create infinite fail loop, in these cases we can <strong>randomize</strong> agents action.</p>
<h2 id=model-based-reflex-agents>Model-based Reflex Agents</h2>
<p>The most effective way to handle partial observability is for the agent to keep track of the part of the world it can&rsquo;t see now. That is, the agent should maintain some sort of <strong>internal state</strong> that
depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state.</p>
<p>Updating this internal state information as time goes by requires two kinds of knowledge to be encoded in the agent program in some form. First, we need some information about how the world changes over
time, which can be divided roughly into two parts: the effects of the agent’s actions and how the world evolves independently of the agent. i.e. if agent turns right the car goes right; if raining the
cameras get wet. This knowledge about world is called a <strong>transition model</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, we need some information about how the state of the world is reflected in the agent’s percepts. For example, when the car in front initiates braking, one or more illuminated red regions appear in
the forward-facing camera image. This kind of knowledge is called <strong>sensor model</strong>.</p>
<p>Together, the transition model and sensor model allow an agent to keep track of the state of the world—to the extent possible given the limitations of the agent’s sensors. An agent that uses such models
is called a <strong>model-based agent</strong>.</p>
<h2 id=goal-based-agents>Goal-based Agents</h2>
<p>Knowing something about the current state of the environment is not always enough to decide what to do. For example, at a road junction, the taxi can turn left, turn right, or go straight on. The correct
decision depends on where the taxi is trying to get to and for that agent needs some sort of <strong>goal</strong> information (i.e. being at final destination).</p>
<p>The agent program can combine this with the model (the same information as was used in the model-based reflex agent) to choose actions that achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Sometimes goal-based action selection is straightforward—for example, when goal satisfaction results immediately from a single action. Sometimes it will be more tricky—for example, when the agent has to
consider long sequences of twists and turns in order to find a way to achieve the goal. <strong>Search</strong> and <strong>Planning</strong> are the subfields of AI devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent&rsquo;s
goals.</p>
<h2 id=utility-based-agents>Utility-based Agents</h2>
<p>Goals alone are not enough to generate high-quality behavior in most environments. For example, many action sequences will get the taxi to its destination (thereby achieving the goal), but some are
quicker, safer, more reliable, or cheaper than others. For this we use term <strong>utility</strong>-the quality of being useful; therefore how happy the agent is. An agent’s utility function is essentially an
internalization of the performance measure. Provided that the internal utility function and the external performance measure are in agreement, an agent that chooses actions to maximize its utility
will be rational according to the external performance measure.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, a rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the <strong>expected utility</strong> of the action outcomes—that is, the utility the agent expects to derive, on average, given the
probabilities and utilities of each outcome.</p>
<h1 id=agents-summary>Agents Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An agent is something that perceives and acts in an environment. The agent function for an agent specifies the action taken by the agent in response to any percept sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance measure evaluates the behavior of the agent in an environment. A rational agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of the performance measure, given the percept sequence it has
seen so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task environment specification includes the performance measure, the external environment, the actuators, and the sensors. In designing an agent, the first step must always be to specify the task
environment as fully as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task environments vary along several significant dimensions. They can be fully or partially observable, single-agent or multiagent, deterministic or nondeterministic, episodic or sequential, static or
dynamic, discrete or continuous, and known or unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where the performance measure is unknown or hard to specify correctly, there is a significant risk of the agent optimizing the wrong objective. In such cases the agent design should reflect
uncertainty about the true objective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agent program implements the agent function. There exists a variety of basic agent program designs reflecting the kind of information made explicit and used in the decision process. The designs
vary in efficiency, compactness, and flexibility. The appropriate design of the agent program depends on the nature of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple reflex agents respond directly to percepts, whereas model-based reflex agents maintain internal state to track aspects of the world that are not evident in the current percept. Goal-based agents
act to achieve their goals, and utility-based agents try to maximize their own expected “happiness.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All agents can improve their performance through learning.</p>

<h2 id=van-emde-boas-tree>van Emde Boas Tree</h2>
<p>is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m-bit integer keys. It performs all operations in O(log m) time or equivalently in O(log log M) time where M = 2^M is the maximum
number of elements that can be stored in the tree. The M is not to be confused with the actual number of elements stored in the tree, by which the performance of other tree data-structures is often measured.</p>

<p>results in a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>We are taking edges with smalles values which connect nodes, that isn&rsquo;t already connected by other edges.</p>
<h1 id=prims-algorithm>Prim&rsquo;s Algorithm</h1>
<p>results in a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>First select random node and add it to &lsquo;visited&rsquo; list.</p>
<p>Take edge with smallest value, which is connected to any node in &lsquo;visited&rsquo; and does not connect elements which are both in &lsquo;visited&rsquo;.1</p>
<h1 id=network-flow>Network Flow</h1>
<h2 id=flow-graph--network>Flow Graph / Network</h2>
<p>graph where edges (also called arcs) have <strong>capacity</strong> which cannot be exceeded and <strong>flow value</strong> which says how many units of flow are passing through the edge. Initial flow is 0 everywhere.</p>
<p>Graph contains <strong>source</strong> and <strong>sing</strong> nodes.</p>
<h2 id=maximum-flow-problem>Maximum Flow Problem</h2>
<p>How much flow can we push through graph without exceeding any capacity</p>
<h2 id=ford-fulkerson-method>Ford-Fulkerson Method</h2>
<p>repeatedly finds augmenting paths through the residual graph and augments the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.</p>
<p>An <strong>augmenting path</strong> is a path of edges in the residual graph with unused capacity greater than zero from the source s to the sink t. Every augmenting path has <strong>bottleneck</strong>, which is the smalles edge
on the path. WE can use the bottlenect value to augment the flow along the path.</p>
<p><strong>Augmenting the flow</strong> means updating the flow values of the edges along the augmenting path. For forward edges, this means <strong>increasing the flow</strong> by the bottleneck value. When augmenting the flow along
the augmenting path, you also need to <strong>decrese the flow</strong> along each residual edge by the bottleneck value. <strong>Residual edges</strong> exist to undo bad augmenting paths which do not lead to a maximum flow
(they decrease flow which will not be needed because of the bottleneck ahead). The residual graph is the graph which also contains residual edges. The residual graph helps us with computation but is not
usually shown as describing problem.</p>
<p>Ford-Fulkerson Method does not specify exact method, but is usuualy done with DFS.</p>
<h1 id=lagrange-multiplier--function>Lagrange Multiplier & Function</h1>
<p>is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.
The basic idea is to convert a constrained problem into a form such that the derivative test of an unconstrained problem can still be applied. The relationship between the gradient of the function and gradients of the constraints rather naturally leads to a reformulation of the original problem, known as the Lagrangian function</p>
<p>The method can be summarized as follows: in order to find the maximum or minimum of a function \( f(x) \) subjected to the equality constraint \( g(x) = 0 \), form the Lagrangian function.
$$
\mathcal{L}(x, \lambda) = f(x) - \lambda g(x)
$$</p>
<h1 id=linear-programming>Linear Programming</h1>
<p>is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Linear programming is a special case of
mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization)</p>
<p>Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in canonical form as</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a vector \( x \)</li>
<li>that maximizes \( c^Tx \)</li>
<li>subject to \( Ax \leq b \)</li>
<li>and \(x \geq 0 \)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=simplex-method>Simplex Method</h2>
<p>//todo</p>
<h1 id=nonlinear-programming>Nonlinear programming</h1>
<p>is the process of solving an optimization problem where some of the constraints or the objective function are nonlinear. An optimization problem is one of calculation of the extrema (maxima, minima or
stationary points) of an objective function over a set of unknown real variables and conditional to the satisfaction of a system of equalities and inequalities, collectively termed constraints. It is the
sub-field of mathematical optimization that deals with problems that are not linear.</p>
<h2 id=karushkuhntucker-conditions>Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions</h2>
<p>KKT conditions are first derivative tests (sometimes called first-order necessary conditions) for a solution in nonlinear programming to be optimal, provided that some regularity conditions are
satisfied.</p>
<p>Conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stationarity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Primal feasibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dual feasibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Complementary slackness</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id=convex-optimization>Convex Optimization</h1>
<p>is a subfield of mathematical optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. Many classes of convex optimization problems admit polynomial-time algorithms,[1]
whereas mathematical optimization is in general NP-hard.</p>

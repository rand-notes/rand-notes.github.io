# Countable Addiitivity Axiom

> If \\( A_1, A,2, ... \\) is an infinite sequence of disjoint events, then \\( P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + ... \\)


Addiitivity holds only for countable sequences of events

The unit square (similarly, the real line etc) is not countable (its elements cannot be arranged in a sequence)

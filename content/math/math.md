# Pursuit Curve


A curve of pursuit is a curve constructed by analogy to having a point or points representing pursuers and pursuees; the curve of pursuit is the curve traced by the pursuers. With the paths of the
pursuer and pursuee parameterized in time, the pursuee is always on the pursuer's tangent.

e.g. one plane chasing another. The plane that is being chased must have predetermined path (flying upwards, in circle etc.). Chasing plane always moves in direction of plane being chased.


# Differential Equations

## Order

The order of a differential equation is the highest order of any differential contained in it.

## Ordinary vs. partial

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) contains differentials with respect to only one variable, partial differential equations (PDE) contain differentials with respect to several independent variables.

## Linear vs. non-linear

Linear differential equations do not contain any higher powers of either the dependent variable (function) or any of its differentials, non-linear differential equations do.

## Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous

A differential equation is homogeneous if it contains no non-differential terms and heterogeneous if it does.
